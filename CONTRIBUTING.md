# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on
[Github](https://github.com/paul-thebaud/phpunitgen-core).

Informal discussion regarding bugs, new features, and implementation of
existing features takes place in the
[Github issue page](https://github.com/paul-thebaud/phpunitgen-core/issues).

## Pull Requests

- PhpUnitGen follows the
[PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)
coding standard and the
[PSR-4](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md)
autoloading standard. **We are using [StyleCI](https://styleci.io/)**,
so don't worry if your code styling isn't perfect!

- **Add tests!** Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour.** Make sure the `README.md` and any
other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Create feature branches.** Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature.** If you want to do more than one thing,
send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history.** Make sure each individual commit in your pull
request is meaningful.


## Running Tests

``` bash
$ php ./vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit.xml.dist
```

**Happy coding**!
